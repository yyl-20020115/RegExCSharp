# RegExCSharp
Regular Expression Implementation
Implementation of an regular expression engine.
Source code is from Internet and I did some refactor work to make it easier to learn.

However. it was early stage, and a much better version with better algorithm on NFA (Thompson search algorithm) is implemented 
within SRegex project of SParser solution. Please check it there.
